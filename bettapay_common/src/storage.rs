//! Shared storage helpers.
//!
//! Each contract keeps its own private `DataKey` enum for keys that are
//! contract-specific (e.g. settlement's `Merchant(Address)` or governance's
//! `Anchor(Address)`). The keys that are semantically shared — the pause
//! flag, the recovery address, and the pending recovery operation — live in
//! [`CommonDataKey`] so every contract reads and writes them in exactly the
//! same shape. The admin role is *not* one of these: both contracts store it
//! as a multisig `Vec<Address>` under their own `DataKey::Admin`, so there is
//! no single-`Address` shape for this crate to own.
//!
//! The on-chain SCVal encoding of a Soroban `#[contracttype]` enum is based on
//! the variant name only; the parent enum's Rust name is not part of the
//! encoding. So a value written under `governance_contract::DataKey::Paused`
//! reads back identically through `bettapay_common::CommonDataKey::Paused`,
//! which is what allows both contracts to share this enum without disturbing
//! any existing storage entry.
//!
//! ## Pause helpers
//!
//! The full pause lifecycle — flag storage, event emission, and idempotency
//! semantics — is consolidated here so neither contract re-implements it:
//!
//! | Helper | What it does |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`is_paused`] | Reads the flag; bumps instance TTL |
//! | [`set_paused`] | Writes the flag (raw; no event) |
//! | [`apply_pause`] | Writes `true` **and** emits `paused` event |
//! | [`apply_unpause`] | Writes `false` **and** emits `unpaused` event |
//!
//! Contracts call [`apply_pause`] / [`apply_unpause`] from their `pause` /
//! `unpause` entry-points after verifying admin auth and idempotency (which
//! must panic with contract-specific error types and therefore cannot live
//! here). The `assert_not_paused` guards in each contract remain thin
//! wrappers that call [`is_paused`] and panic with their own `Error::Paused`.
