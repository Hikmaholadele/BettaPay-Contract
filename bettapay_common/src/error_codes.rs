//! Canonical error-code registry shared by every BettaPay contract.
//!
//! Soroban's `#[contracterror]` macro requires each contract to define its
//! own error enum (it becomes part of that contract's WASM interface), so
//! this module cannot export a single shared enum. Instead it fixes the
//! *numeric* meaning of every code: each contract's error enum must use
//! these constants as explicit discriminants rather than picking its own
//! numbers. This is what makes a raw error code returned from either
//! contract unambiguous to an off-chain client without it needing to know
//! which contract produced it.
//!
//! Ranges:
//! - `1..=99`   — codes shared by two or more contracts (this module).
//! - `200..=299` — reserved for `governance_contract`-only codes.
//! - `300..=399` — reserved for `settlement_contract`-only codes.
//!
//! Adding a new contract-specific error: pick the next free number in that
//! contract's range. Adding a new *shared* concept: add a constant here in
//! the `1..=99` range and update every contract that needs it. Either way,
//! [`assert_no_code_collisions`] (exercised by both contracts' test suites)
//! will fail the build if two different concepts end up sharing a number.
