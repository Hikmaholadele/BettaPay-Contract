//! # BettaPay Governance Contract
//!
//! This contract is the single source of truth for protocol-wide configuration
//! in the BettaPay network. It controls who may act as administrators, what fee
//! rates are applied across all settlement flows, which off-chain anchors are
//! trusted for each asset, and a set of extensible numeric system parameters
//! that downstream contracts can read on-demand.
//!
//! ## Key Concepts
//!
//! ### Admin Controls
//! A single privileged `admin` address owns the contract. The admin is stored
//! in instance storage and is set once during [`GovernanceContract::init`].
//! Ownership can be transferred via [`GovernanceContract::transfer_admin`] to
//! any non-zero, non-self address. All mutating entry-points check
//! `caller == admin` before calling `caller.require_auth()`.
//!
//! ### Contract Upgrade
//! [`GovernanceContract::upgrade`] replaces the running Wasm executable without
//! touching storage. The caller must be the admin. After an upgrade, the new
//! code takes over immediately; if a storage-schema migration is needed, a
//! separate migration function should be invoked in the same transaction.
//!
//! ### Upgrade Process
//! `upgrade` is safe because it ignores storage, which is also why changing a
//! stored type is a separate problem. Nothing converts existing entries, and
//! nothing checks that they still match the types the new code expects — a
//! mismatched read fails at runtime, after the upgrade has landed.
//!
//! 1. Wasm upgrades replace code only; every storage entry survives untouched.
//! 2. Storage migrations run **inside the upgraded contract**, as an
//!    admin-gated `migrate` entry point — not from a separate migration
//!    contract. A contract can only reach its own storage, so another contract
//!    has no access path to these entries.
//! 3. Ship the old type definition in the same Wasm as the new one. It is what
//!    makes existing entries readable while they are converted.
//! 4. Order is: upgrade the Wasm, then call `migrate`, then verify the
//!    post-upgrade state, then remove the migration code in a later upgrade.
//! 5. `Anchor(Address)` and `SystemParam(Symbol)` are keyed by value and
//!    Soroban cannot enumerate storage keys, so those cannot be migrated by
//!    iteration. Convert them lazily on read, or pass the keys in explicitly.
//!
//! Full guidance, including worked examples and the TTL hazards, is in
//! [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](https://github.com/Betta-Pay/BettaPay-Contract/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md).
//!
//! ### Pause / Unpause
//! The admin can halt all mutating governance operations by calling
//! [`GovernanceContract::pause`]. This sets a boolean flag in instance storage
//! and emits a `paused` event. All entry-points that write state call the
//! internal `assert_not_paused` guard. The contract is re-enabled with
//! [`GovernanceContract::unpause`], which emits an `unpaused` event.
//!
//! ## Pause Model
//! The pause flag blocks the anchor registry and fee configuration
//! (`upsert_anchor`, `remove_anchor`, `set_fee_config` all call
//! `assert_not_paused`). The following administrative operations are
//! intentionally NOT blocked during pause, so the admin can fix the root
//! cause of the emergency:
//! - `upgrade` — deploy a fix
//! - `transfer_admin` — rotate compromised keys
//! - `change_threshold` — re-balance the admin multisig
//! - `update_system_param` — adjust system configuration
//! - `initiate_recovery` / `cancel_recovery` / `execute_recovery` — repair a
//!   lost or corrupted admin set
//!
//! This matrix is pinned by `pause_blocks_fee_and_anchor_writes` and
//! `pause_allows_admin_transfer_threshold_and_recovery`. See also
//! [`adr/001-selective-pause-model.md`](https://github.com/Betta-Pay/BettaPay-Contract/blob/main/adr/001-selective-pause-model.md).
//!
//! ### Fee Configuration
//! [`GovernanceContract::set_fee_config`] stores a [`FeeConfig`] struct that
//! expresses platform and network fees in basis points (bps, 1 bps = 0.01 %).
//! Both values must independently satisfy:
//!
//! - `MIN_FEE_BPS` (5 bps, 0.05 %) ≤ value ≤ `MAX_FEE_BPS` (5 000 bps, 50 %)
//! - `platform_fee_bps + network_fee_bps` ≤ 10 000 bps (100 %)
//!
//! Violating any constraint panics with [`GovernanceError::InvalidFeeBps`].
//! The current config is readable via [`GovernanceContract::get_fee_config`].
//! The entry emits a `fee_config_updated` event on every successful write.
//!
//! ### Anchor Registry
//! Each supported asset can nominate a trusted off-chain anchor address via
//! [`GovernanceContract::upsert_anchor`]. The anchor address is stored keyed by
//! the asset [`Address`][soroban_sdk::Address] in persistent storage.
//! [`GovernanceContract::remove_anchor`] deletes the entry; attempting to
//! remove an asset that has no registered anchor panics with
//! [`GovernanceError::AnchorMissing`]. Both operations emit events
//! (`anchor_upserted` / `anchor_removed`) for off-chain indexers.
//! TTL of the anchor entry is extended on every read via
//! [`GovernanceContract::get_anchor`].
//!
//! ### System Parameters
//! [`GovernanceContract::update_system_param`] stores an arbitrary `i128`
//! value under a caller-supplied [`Symbol`][soroban_sdk::Symbol] key. This
//! gives the admin a flexible mechanism to propagate numeric knobs (e.g.,
//! maximum settlement delay, minimum collateral ratio) to other contracts
//! without upgrading the governance contract itself. Parameters are read via
//! [`GovernanceContract::get_system_param`], which also refreshes the
//! persistent-entry TTL.
//!
//! ## Error Codes
//!
//! | Code | Variant | Meaning |
//! |------|---------|---------|
//! | 1 | `AlreadyInitialized` | `init` called more than once |
//! | 2 | `NotInitialized` | Admin not yet set |
//! | 3 | `Unauthorized` | Caller is not the admin |
//! | 4 | `InvalidFeeBps` | Fee value out of range or combined sum > 10 000 bps |
//! | 5 | `Paused` | Contract is paused |
//! | 6 | `InvalidAdmin` | Transfer target is zero-address or current admin |
//! | 7 | `InvalidRecoveryAddress` | Recovery address is zero-address or otherwise invalid |
//! | 8 | `RecoveryNotPending` | No recovery operation is currently pending |
//! | 9 | `RecoveryDelayActive` | Recovery delay period has not yet elapsed |
//! | 13 | `InvalidWasmInterface` | The deployed WASM does not implement the required interface |
//! | 14 | `InvalidThreshold` | The provided multisig threshold is invalid |
//! | 15 | `AlreadyPaused` | `pause` called while the contract was already paused |
//! | 16 | `AlreadyUnpaused` | `unpause` called while the contract was already unpaused |
//! | 200 | `AnchorMissing` | Tried to remove an unregistered anchor |
//! | 201 | `InvalidParamValue` | Supplied system parameter value is invalid or out of bounds |
//! | 204 | `SameAdmin` | Transfer target is identical to the current admin set and threshold |
//!
//! ## Event Conventions
//!
//! Events are emitted via [`soroban_sdk::Env::events`]. To give off-chain
//! indexers a predictable topic layout, every event in this contract follows
//! the same conventions:
//!
//! - `topic[0]` is always the event name as a [`Symbol`], constructed via
//!   [`Symbol::new`]. Indexers filter on this single topic to dispatch by
//!   event type.
//! - `topic[1..n]` carry the entity identifiers that scope the event —
//!   typically an [`Address`] (asset, admin, recovery address), but for some
//!   events also a [`BytesN<32>`] (new Wasm hash on `contract_upgraded`) or a
//!   [`Symbol`] (system-parameter key on `sys_param_updated`). The exact
//!   shape of `topic[1..n]` is fixed per event.
//! - The **data payload** carries the values describing the state change.
//!   Its shape is event-specific: a single value, a tuple, a typed struct
//!   such as [`AdminTransferred`], or `()`.
//! - Each entry point emits exactly the events tied to the state change it
//!   performs; no two events emitted by the same call describe the same
//!   logical change.
//!
//! ## Emitted Events
//!
//! | Event symbol | Trigger |
//! |---|---|
//! | `initialized` | Contract initialized |
//! | `contract_upgraded` | Wasm upgrade succeeded |
//! | `admin_transferred` | Admin transfer completed |
//! | `threshold_changed` | Multisig threshold changed |
//! | `paused` | Contract paused |
//! | `unpaused` | Contract unpaused |
//! | `recovery_initiated` / `recovery_cancelled` / `recovery_executed` | Admin-recovery lifecycle |
//! | `sys_param_updated` | System parameter updated |
//! | `fee_config_updated` | Fee configuration changed |
//! | `anchor_upserted` | Anchor created or replaced for an asset | Data: `(Option<Address> previous, Address current)` |
//! | `anchor_removed` | Anchor removed for an asset |
