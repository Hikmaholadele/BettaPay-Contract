//! Cross-contract error-code conformity test for issue #517.
//!
//! Governance and settlement error codes used to be numbered independently,
//! so the same code could mean different things in each contract (e.g. code
//! 12 was `AlreadyPaused` in governance but `InvalidPaymentReference` in
//! settlement). Both enums now derive their discriminants from
//! `bettapay_common::error_codes`, and each contract's own module has a
//! `const _: ()` block asserting its enum matches the registry. This test
//! adds the piece those per-crate checks can't: proof that the two full
//! error tables, read together, never disagree about what a code means.
