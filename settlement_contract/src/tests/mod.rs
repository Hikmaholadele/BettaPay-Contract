//! Shared test utilities for the settlement contract test suite.
//!
//! This module exposes the common `setup()` helper, the `MockGovernance` contract
//! used in most tests, and the `register_governance` helper. Feature-specific
//! test modules are declared here so Rust can discover them during `cargo test`.
